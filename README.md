LocoShapes
==========

A small framework for rendering with Windows GDI+ and DirectX10. The aim of the project was to demonstrate well structured code (so it ain't pretty).

- Loads in shapes from file.
- Renders shapes using Windows GDI+ and/or DirectX10 (you can switch).
- Updates/moves buttons using delta tick.
- Features UI for switching renderer and loading/reloading shape data.

Best compatability with VS2010 and Microsoft DirectX SDK (June 2010). I have included all the libraries and runtimes so it should work fine if you do not have the SDK.
